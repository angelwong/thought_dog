== Summary

Thought Dog is an open source educational software platform being developed by Nathan Hayes-Roth as part of Columbia University's COMS W3101 - Ruby on Rails Course.


== Homework 2 Notes

-Parts 1-4 complete, currently working on bonus

-Mongoids has_and_belongs_to_many relationship was causing a mixed relation error when trying to link embedded objects (users and courses)
-Added a new model (Enrollment) which embeds users, courses, and sections to avoid the issue

== Rails Console Commands

first_enrollment = Enrollment.new
